# Uranus-Wireframe-Hero

I wanted to make a responsive design of the home page with HTML/CSS Flexbox,
I used @media query for responsive for the first time, also I used css pseudo-elements for menu links animation


### What I learned

I got a better understanding of how flexbox works, what pseudo elements are,
and learned how to animate different elements when hovering over them
